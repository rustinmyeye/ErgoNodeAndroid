# Ergo Node for Android  

Setup instructions [here](https://github.com/rustinmyeye/ErgoNodeAndroid/blob/master/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

or if you'd like to run the setup scripts within **Termux** use:
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustinmyeye/ErgoNodeAndroid/master/alpine-ergo-setup.sh | sh
```

A one-click Ergo node app for Android. This app is based on **NeoTerm**, and runs automated install scripts to set up and run an Ergo node on Android.

During setup, the script will check the total and available system memory to determine which type of node to run:

- If the device has **more than 5GB of total RAM**, it will run the **NiPoPoW Ergo Node**.
- If the total RAM is **5GB or less**, it will check available memory:
  - If **more than 1.8GB is available**, it will still run the RocksDB **NiPoPoW Ergo Node**.
  - If **less than 1.8GB is available**, it will switch to the **Stateless Ergo Node**, which requires fewer resources.

This is a fork of [NeoTerm](https://github.com/NeoTerm/NeoTerm)

Iâ€™m using a bunch of parts from Glasgow's Ergo Node setup scripts. [Mark Glasgow](https://github.com/glasgowm148/ergoscripts)

Also - [alpine-proot](https://github.com/Yonle/alpine-proot), [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/), [Ergo Protocol reference client](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases)

## **Notes**

I figured out how to bootstrap via **Nipopow** and **UTXO set snapshot** on **Android**. So far it is only working for me with **RocksDB node 5.1.2**.  

Some important points:

- If you run a **Nipopow node**, there is **no way to see its progress in the panel**. It downloads chunks in the background, so just stick with it, or connect a keyboard Ior use an onscreen keyboard with Ctrl keys) and watch logs.  
- One day I want to figure out how to **add a progress bar for Nipopow chunks** in the panel.  
- It is important to enable wake lock for the app, disable power optimization, and phantom process killing to make this reliable.

Compatibility notes:

- **LevelDB versions** are not working with **aarch64**, when using NiPoPow config even if I try the official aarch64 release.  
- **Termux** and **Neoterm** do not have glibc (it uses musl libc like Alpine Linux), so **RocksDB does not work out of the box**. The workaround is to enable glibc compatibility by installing gcompat in an **Alpine Linux proot** or set up an **Arch Linux proot** to run it.
